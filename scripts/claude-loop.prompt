You are running an automated fix loop in this repository.

Goal (one per run):
- Find ONE concrete issue (failing test, compiler error, clear bug, crash, UB, TODO/FIXME with evidence) and fix it.
- Keep the change minimal and safe.

Constraints:
- Follow all project constraints in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (ASAP-first; no stop-the-world / GC-style pauses).
- Do not refactor broadly or change architecture.
- Do not add new features.
- Do not run git commit; leave changes unstaged.

Validation:
- Prefer targeted checks. If needed, run: `make test` (or `./tests.sh`).
- Keep runtime reasonable; avoid long-running steps unless required to validate the fix.

Output contract (required):
- If no actionable issue is found OR the fix would be too large, output exactly:
  NO_ISSUES
- Otherwise, output a single line at the end:
  COMMIT_MSG: <imperative summary <= 65 chars>
