You are running an automated fix loop in this repository.

Goal (one per run):
- First, read BUGS.md and FIXME.md. If either lists open/unresolved items, pick the earliest unresolved item and fix it.
- Only when both files have no open/unresolved items, find ONE concrete issue (failing test, compiler error, clear bug, crash, UB, TODO/FIXME with evidence, implementation gap) and fix it.
- Keep the change minimal and safe.

Constraints:
- Follow all project constraints in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (ASAP-first; no stop-the-world / GC-style pauses).
- Do not  change architecture. you can refactor if you find an implementation gap and is needed, otherwise don't.
- Do not add new features.
- add tests
- commit and push changes; 

Validation:
- Prefer targeted checks. If needed, run: `make test` (or `./tests.sh`).
- Keep runtime reasonable; avoid long-running steps unless required to validate the fix.

Output contract (required):
- If no actionable issue is found OR the fix would be too large, output exactly:
  NO_ISSUES
- Otherwise, output a single line at the end:
  COMMIT_MSG: <imperative summary <= 65 chars>
